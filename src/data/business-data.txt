Top 10 Foods to Boost Neurogenesis
- Blueberries
Rich in antioxidants, especially flavonoids like anthocyanins. They fight oxidative stress and
enhance brain plasticity.
- Turmeric (Curcumin)
Curcumin boosts BDNF and reduces inflammation. Mix with black pepper for better absorption.
- Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Found in salmon, walnuts, chia seeds. They protect neurons and support new cell growth.
- Green Tea
Contains EGCG which promotes brain cell growth, calms anxiety, and sharpens focus.
- Dark Chocolate
Flavonoids in dark chocolate improve blood flow and BDNF. Choose 70% or higher cocoa content.
- Leafy Greens
Spinach, kale, and moringa are rich in folate and antioxidants that support memory and brain health.
- Fermented Foods
Kimchi, curd, and pickles enhance gut health, which supports brain function via the gut-brain axis.
- Walnuts & Almonds
Rich in Vitamin E and healthy fats. These nuts help preserve and grow neurons.
- Avocados
Full of healthy fats and folate. They increase blood flow to the brain and support memory.
- Eggs
The yolk contains choline, essential for neurotransmitter production and brain communication.

The Soulful Guide to Neurogenesis

Other Powerful Triggers of Neurogenesis
- Dancing: Combines music, rhythm, emotion, and movement to activate multiple brain regions and
release BDNF.
- Exercise: Regular aerobic exercise like walking, jogging, or cycling increases BDNF and stimulates
neurogenesis.
- Meditation: Reduces cortisol, boosts focus, and promotes new brain cell growth by calming the
mind and reducing inflammation.
- Deep Sleep: Most neurogenesis occurs during deep sleep. Prioritize 7-8 hours of quality sleep.
- Intermittent Fasting: Light fasting (like 16:8) enhances BDNF and triggers brain repair
mechanisms.
- Learning New Things: Any mentally stimulating activity (like learning a dance, language, or
instrument) builds new neural connections.
- Emotional Well-being: Joy, gratitude, laughter, and love trigger feel-good chemicals (dopamine,
oxytocin) that support brain health.
- Connection with Nature: Spending time in nature reduces stress and supports neurogenesis.
- Low Sugar, Anti-inflammatory Diet: Reducing processed sugar and eating whole, anti-inflammatory
foods supports brain cell health.

Why Dancing Triggers Neurogenesis

When you're dancing, especially the kind of expressive, joyful dancing you do in Anyone Can
Dance,
your brain goes into a magical mode - and yes, it can actually create new brain cells,
a process called neurogenesis.

The Soulful Guide to Neurogenesis

Let's break down why dancing triggers this:

1. Physical Movement Boosts Brain Growth
When you dance, your body releases a protein called BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor).
BDNF is like a fertilizer for your brain - it encourages new neurons to grow,
especially in the hippocampus, the area linked to memory and learning.

2. Dancing Combines Music + Movement + Emotion
This multi-sensory stimulation activates many parts of your brain at once -
coordination, rhythm, memory, emotions, creativity.
This intense engagement triggers the brain to rewire itself and create new neural connections,
promoting plasticity and even new cell creation.
3. Emotional Expression + Joy = Healing
Dancing joyfully or emotionally triggers a dopamine release (your brain's happiness chemical).
Dopamine encourages brain cell regeneration and supports overall brain health.
4. Learning New Choreography Challenges Your Brain
When you learn a new step, your brain has to form new pathways to store and recall it.
This challenge activates cognitive functions, pushing your brain to create new cells
to keep up with your growing dance intelligence.
So dancing doesn't just move your body - it literally grows your brain.
You're not just training your body at Anyone Can Dance...
The Soulful Guide to Neurogenesis
You're training minds, healing hearts, and growing brains.

Asamyuta Hastas (one-hand gesture)

This page describes the different hand gestures used in Bharathanatyam. Hastas / Mudras
(hand gestures) are primarily classified as 28 Asamyuta Hastas (one-hand gesture) and 24
Samyuta Hastas (two-hand gestures).
Each of the hastas can be used to denote various thoughts, ideas and objects. There are
various slokas (verses) from the ancient texts that enumerate the usage of the hastas. These
are called Viniyoga Slokas. Apart from the suggested viniyogas, the dancer may innovate, if
found necessary, to convey the appropriate message to the audience.
